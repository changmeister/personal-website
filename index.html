                <br>
                <p> I'm am a junior studying computer science at the <a href = https://umich.edu>University of Michigan</a> in Ann Arbor, MI. 
            On campus, I am an active member of <a href = http://www.hmcc.net>Harvest Mission Community Church</a> and my professional technology fraternity, 
                <a href = https://kappathetapi.com>Kappa Theta Pi</a>. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p> I currently work part-time as a computer science instructor at <a href = https://junilearning.com>Juni Learning</a>. Every week, I teach six K-12 students about Python and block programming.
                Previously, I worked as a team leader at a STEM summer camp called  <a href = https://galileo-camps.com>Camp Galileo</a>. At camp, I led a group of twenty first graders and helped teach them STEM.
                In addition, I worked with my peers and mentors to plan events for over 200 campers. I love spreading my passion for technology to other people, especially children.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                In my free time, I enjoy watching korean dramas, going to grab boba with my friends, and playing video games and board games. 
                In addition, I love learning new things outside of the classroom. Currently, I am learning more about PHP and AWS.
