                <h2>Personal Website</h2>
                <p class = "project-tags">HTML/CSS, JavaScript | November 2020 - Present</p>
                <p> I desired to learn more and to improve my web development skills, so I decided to create this personal website. Through this project, I was able to get my first exposure to JavaScript and learn about media queries.</p>

                <p class = "project-tags">Python | August 2020 - Present </p>
                <p> Wanting to efficiently check whether prices dropped on the H&M Store, I used Python's Beautiful Soup to extract different item prices and compare them to previous prices. If the price dropped, I would automatically be notified through email. I was able to improve my skills with the Pandas library and get exposure of smtplib. </p>

                <p>DJ 183 is a music guessing quiz website. The player will hear a song and will guess among four options. The website would then tell the player if they were right or wrong and also show the lyrics of the song played on the side, which we were able to get by using MetroLyrics.com API. In addition, we used FireBase to keep track of player scores in real time and implemented a live leaderboard. </p>
